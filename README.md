# N&M Games Cinnamon Theme
A Cinnamon theme with the style of [N&M Games](https://nm-games.eu).

## Composition
This theme was made by modifying the color values, textures and margin/padding of:
- [Adapta-Nokto by smurphos](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/Adapta-Nokto);
- [Windows 10 Light Theme by smurphos](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/Windows-10).

## Will it work?
This theme has been designed and tested on the Cinnamon edition of Linux Mint 21. Therefore, it will certainly work there.  
It works best on Linux Mint 21 and higher, and on Linux Mint 20.3 as well, although some small features may not work 100% properly.  
Success is not granted on other distributions. As the README progresses, I assume that you use Linux Mint (Cinnamon edition).

## Installing
You can install the theme by cloning the repository into your `~/.local/share/themes` folder:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NM-Games/cinnamon-theme
```

> On Linux Mint version 21 and older, themes are normally stored in `~/.themes`.

If the themes folder does not exist, launch the *Themes* application to automatically generate it.  
When cloned, open *Themes* and choose *cinnamon-theme* for **Applications** and **Desktop** (on Linux Mint 21 or higher).

> If you use another version than Linux Mint 21 or higher, it might still work, although we cannot guarantee so. The places where *cinnamon-theme* must be selected might be different as well.

## Updating
When you see a new commit on this repository, you can update the theme by pulling the repository first:
```bash
git pull
```
...and then, load another theme in the *Themes* application, and finally, load *cinnamon-theme* again.  
If you see no changes, you can try *Ctrl*+*Alt*+*Backspace* to restart Cinnamon. **Warning:** this force-quits all open applications, be aware!

## Features
When you installed the theme correctly, it will:
- give your taskbar/panel and it's menus N&M Games colors;
- give windows N&M Games styled title bars and close buttons;
- give the radio buttons, checkboxes, switches and buttons another look.

### Not included
The following things are **not** included in the theme, but can be done as well to give it the full N&M Games look:
- The N&M Games font family, Balsamiq Sans. You can download that [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans);
- The N&M Games icon for the bottom left menu. You can download that [here](https://nm-games.eu/static/img/nm/icon.png);
- Folder icons. We recommend to set that to *Mint-Y-Dark-Blue* (Mint 21 and lower) or *Mint-Y-Legacy-Dark-Blue* (Mint 21.1) to blend in with the N&M Games colors.

We hope you enjoy the N&M Games Linux Theme!
