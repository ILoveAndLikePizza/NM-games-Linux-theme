# N&M Games Linux Theme
A Linux theme with the design of my gaming website, [N&M Games](https://nm-games.eu). Made by downloading other themes and modifying their CSS files a bit.

## Will it work?
This theme has been designed and tested on Linux Mint, the Linux distribution I use. Therefore, it will certainly work on that distribution.  
It works best on Linux Mint 21, and on Linux Mint 20.3 as well, although some small features may not work 100% properly.  
Success is not granted on other distributions. As the README progresses, I assume that you use Linux Mint. Or Cinnamon. I don't know how all that stuff works :)

## Installing
You can install the theme by cloning the repository into your `~/.themes` folder:  
```bash
ILoveAndLikePizza@ILoveAndLikePizza:~/.themes$ git clone https://github.com/ILoveAndLikePizza/NM-games-Linux-theme
```

If the `~/.themes` folder does not exist, launch the *Themes* application to generate it.  
When cloned, open *Themes* and choose *NM-games-Linux-theme* for:
- **Window borders**, **Controls** and **Desktop** on Linux Mint 20.3;
- **Applications** and **Desktop** on Linux Mint 21;
- And good luck finding it out if you have another version or distribution.  
## Updating
When you see a new commit on this repository, you can update the theme by pulling the repository first:
```bash
ILoveAndLikePizza@ILoveAndLikePizza:~/.themes/NM-games-Linux-theme$ git pull
```
...and then, load another theme in the *Themes* application, and finally, load *NM-games-Linux-theme* again.  
If you see no changes, you can try *Ctrl*+*Alt*+*Backspace* to restart Cinnamon. **Warning:** this force-quits all open applications, be aware!

## Features
When you installed the theme correctly, it will:
- give your taskbar/panel and it's menus N&M Games colors;
- give windows N&M Games styled title bars and close buttons;
- give the radio buttons, checkboxes, switches and buttons another look.

### Not included
The following things are **not** included in the theme, but can be done as well to give it the full N&M Games look:
- The N&M Games font family, Balsamiq Sans. You can download that [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans);
- The N&M Games icon for the bottom left menu. You can download that [here](https://nm-games.eu/media/icon.png);
- Folder icons. We recommend to set that to *Mint-Y-Dark-Blue* to blend in with the N&M Games colors.

We hope you enjoy the N&M Games Linux Theme!
